**Candidate Number:** 277173  

#### Abstract
This dissertation provides an in-depth exploration of financial risk analysis, focusing on quantitative methods, statistical techniques, and credit risk assessment. Key areas covered include Net Present Value (NPV) calculations, risk measurement metrics, Monte Carlo simulations, and the application of Altman's Z-Score for bankruptcy prediction. The work also delves into regression analysis to uncover housing market trends and the design of a retail business model sensitive to fluctuating factors.

#### Key Topics
- **Net Present Value (NPV) and Returns of an Asset:** Understanding the value of investments through NPV calculations and returns analysis.
- **Risk Quantification:** Metrics like standard deviation, Value at Risk (VaR), and the Sharpe ratio for assessing investment risks.
- **Statistical Methods:** Techniques such as trend analysis, regression analysis, and Monte Carlo simulations for financial forecasting.
- **Credit Risk Analysis:** Evaluating credit risks using models to assess the probability of default, loss given default (LGD), and exposure at default (EAD).

#### In-Depth Analyses
- **Monte Carlo Simulations:** Modelling uncertainty in financial processes, essential for derivatives valuation and portfolio risk management.
- **Credit Risk Models:** Examining empirical studies and practical applications of credit scoring models in financial crises and regulatory frameworks.
- **Altman's Z-Score:** Detailed calculation and interpretation of Z-Scores for public and private companies, highlighting their predictive power for financial distress.

#### Case Studies and Practical Applications
- **Company Evaluations:** Analysis of Apple Inc., Ford Motor Company, and General Motors using Altman's Z-Score.
- **Housing Market Trends:** Regression analysis to identify economic and demographic factors influencing housing markets over the past three decades.
- **Retail Business Model:** Simulation of a hypothetical retail store's profit distribution, evaluating the impact of sales volume, pricing, and cost fluctuations.

#### Conclusion
This dissertation integrates advanced statistical models and quantitative techniques to provide a comprehensive understanding of financial risk management. It emphasizes the importance of empirical data and robust risk assessment frameworks in navigating financial uncertainties and strategic decision-making.
